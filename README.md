## Project Objective
   The objective of this project is to identify the core underlying causes of declining employee performance at INX Future Inc., a leading data analytics and automation solutions provider. Over recent years, there has been a noticeable decrease in employee performance indexes, increased escalations in service delivery, and an 8 percentage point drop in client satisfaction levels. These issues are of growing concern to the top management, particularly in balancing the need to address underperformance without negatively impacting overall employee morale or the company's reputation as a top employer.
