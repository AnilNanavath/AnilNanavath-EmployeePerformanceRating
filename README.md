## Process and Project Insights
* The project likely starts with gathering employee-related data, which includes demographic information, job roles, feedback ratings, and possibly details about training and development programs.
* The next step involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and preparing the data for analysis, ensuring it is in a usable format for accurate analysis.
* The following step involves identifying trends and showcasing the data in a visual format. This project likely aims to identify declining employee performance and may reveal underperforming departments and 
  employees, as well as correlations related to performance. Visualizations such as histograms, pie charts, and bar charts are used to gain insights.
* The data analysis may include adding new columns, applying conditional formatting (such as categorizing age groups), and filtering data to focus on low performance

## Conclusion
* The organization has a larger male workforce, with a total of 725 males, which constitutes approximately 60% of the employees. The female workforce totals 475, making up about 39.6% of the employees.
* The organization's average age generally falls within the 30-35 age group, where we typically see an increase in attrition rates. However, employees in their late 30s tend to stay with the organization longer and make significant contributions to the company's workflow.
